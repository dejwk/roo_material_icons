# roo_material_icons
Collection of icons for use with the [roo_display](https://github.com/dejwk/roo_display) library. Icons are coming from Google's open-source [material icons collection](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons), used in Android and other Google products.

Small sample:

The collection contains over 34000 icon files, and takes a few minutes to compile. If you only need a subset of icons, check out these sub-collections:

* [outlined](https://github.com/dejwk/roo_material_icons_outlined)
* [rounded](https://github.com/dejwk/roo_material_icons_rounded)
* [sharp](https://github.com/dejwk/roo_material_icons_sharp)
